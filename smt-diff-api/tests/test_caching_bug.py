"""
Test cases for the caching bug fix.

Bug: Multiprocessing timeout wrapper couldn't transfer generators through Queue (not picklable).
Fix: Set timeout directly on Z3 solver before creating generator. Generators created in main process.
     Solver checks for timeout and returns 'unknown' status, which is caught and reported as error.
     No double computation, no process management issues, proper timeout enforcement.
