A web-based platform for formal methods tools, providing an easy-to-use interface for model checking, formal verification, and synthesis. Currently, Limboole, Z3, nuXmv, Alloy, and Spectra are integrated into the platform. Due to the modular architecture, more tools can be added easily. 

## Overview and Examples

We started a small overview of the features of the FM Playground and how to use it. The video playlist is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGyeoukah9NYq9ULsIuADG2r2QjX530nf)

## 🚀 VSCode Extension

**New!** You can now use FM Playground directly in Visual Studio Code!

The VSCode extension provides:
- Syntax highlighting for Limboole, SMT-LIB, Spectra, and nuXmv
- Direct execution of verification tools from the command palette
- Integrated output panels for results
- Configurable API endpoints

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run package
# Install the generated .vsix file in VSCode
```

📖 See [VSCODE_EXTENSION.md](VSCODE_EXTENSION.md) for complete documentation.
